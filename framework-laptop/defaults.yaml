# The values seen here are the defaults provided to parametrized

  # Key `state_name` declared here corresponds to the state name
  # defined in `state_name.include`. Only states with truthy values
  # for `state_name.include` will be included in the main formula
  # invocation via init.sls.
  #
  # To add a new state `new-state`, add a `new_key` for it here with a
  # value for `new_key.include` set to the state name - `new-state`:
  #
  # new_key:
  #   include: new-state
  #
  # To disable `some-state`, remove the corresponding key or assign
  # a falsy value to corresponding `some_key.include`. Example:
  #
  # some_key:
  #   include: False
  #
  # Key names should be valid Python variable names and thus cannot
  # contain hyphens. At the time of this writing, all state file names
  # use hyphens instead and are therefore invalid Python variable names.
  # For this reason keys declared here cannot directly serve as state
  # names and thus require adding the corresponding state name as a string
  # to their `.include` keys.
  #
  # NB: `.include` just like any other key's value can be overriden
  # in one of the os maps and/or pillar.

    # hibernate:
    # This profile will not change the default suspend behavior.
    # To enter hibernate mode, you could add a button in GNOME via an
    # extension to get a a hibernate item in your power menu. *Adding
    # such an item has not been tested.* Hibernating via
    # `systemctl hibernate` works fine. Setting the power button action to
    # Hibernate also works as expected.

    # This method will effectively suspend to RAM but also backup the state to
    # disk, for a further reduction in battery usage in suspended state, with
    # the added backup of disk state in the event the laptop drains completely
    # while in suspend mode.
    #
    # suspend_then_hibernate:
    # This option sets the system to suspend mode (as it normally would upon
    # inactivity, the suspend button, or via `systemctl suspend`), however,
    # after the designated wait time it will then enter hibernate mode,
    # writing RAM state to disk and powering off the system. You can edit
    # the behavior of this mode below.
